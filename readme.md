##Back-To-Stock <br>
This project is came to solve next real business task:

Our customer AmazingCo asked to let users to subscribe products that are out of stock.
The idea is to notify customers when the product back in stock.
At the same time they have already in place premium users and also some users may have
priority for particular product categories.
Rules:
- the premium user has a high priority
- users elder than 70 years old has:
- high priority for medical products
- medium priority for all categories
- FIFO for all the rest
